# Styleguidekit Pattern Lab DEG Web
The static assets for the DEG StyleguideKit for Pattern Lab. Contains styles and mark-up for Pattern Lab's front-end.

# Static Assets for the Default StyleguideKit

These static assets are meant to be used with the default [Mustache](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default) and [Twig](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-twig-default) StyleguideKits. They control the look, feel, and functionality of the front-end of Pattern Lab PHP.

## Development Requirements

In order to modify these assets you need to install the following:

* the [Development Edition of Pattern Lab PHP](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-development)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and NPM
* [Bower](http://bower.io)
* [Ruby Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)

## Making Changes

To make changes **always edit files in `src/`**. To make sure that these changes are reflected in the front-end and `dist/` folder run the following:

    gulp --copy-dist=../../../public

To watch for changes you can use:

    gulp --watch --copy-dist=../../../public

At this point changes to the static assets should compile to the correct locations in the project as well as `dist/`.
